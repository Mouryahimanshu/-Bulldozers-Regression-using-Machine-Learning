# ðŸšœ Predicting the Sale Price of Bulldozers using Machine Learning
In this notebook, we're going to go through an example machine learning project with the goal of predicting the sale price of bulldozers.

##  1. Problem defition
How well can we predict the future sale price of a bulldozer, given its characteristics and previous examples of how much similar bulldozers have been sold for?

## 2. Data
The data is downloaded from the Kaggle Bluebook for Bulldozers competition: [https://www.kaggle.com/c/bluebook-for-bulldozers/data]
